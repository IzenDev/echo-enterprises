## ‚ùå Minimal Mods

Keeping the Mod count low increases load times and performance, so we did that! At most, this modpack will contain 60 mods (Not including needed dependencies) and will consider the lower-spec hardware on older computers.

Support can be found on our Discord server, which can be found [**Here**](http://dsc.gg/echo-mc)
