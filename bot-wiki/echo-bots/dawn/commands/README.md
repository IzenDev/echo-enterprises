# üìç Commands

Dawn uses **SLASH COMMANDS**, which are easy to use and are approved by Discord.

* This allows for faster command execution as well, as these can allow less code to run in the background to check for required permissions, arguments, etc.\

* This also makes it easy for users (like You) to properly fill in the arguments and understand what the command does.

## Commands in their respective categories are listed below:

{% content-ref url="utility.md" %}
[utility.md](utility.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="moderation.md" %}
[moderation.md](moderation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="economy.md" %}
[economy.md](economy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="user.md" %}
[user.md](user.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
