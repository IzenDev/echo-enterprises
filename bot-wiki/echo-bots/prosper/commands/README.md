# üìç Commands

Prosper uses **SLASH COMMANDS,** just like Dawn. These are easy to use, remember, and are the approved way from Discord.

* This allows for faster command execution as well, as these can allow less code to run in the background to check for required permissions, arguments, etc.\

* This also makes it easy for users (like You) to properly fill in the arguments and understand what the command does.

## Commands are listed below:

{% content-ref url="economy.md" %}
[economy.md](economy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
